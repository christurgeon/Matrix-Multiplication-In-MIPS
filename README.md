# Matrix-Multiplication-In-MIPS
This matrix multiplication program is written in MIPS Assembly. It makes system calls to read in the dimensions of the two matrices and then takes user input to fill the matrices with integer values. It then multiplies the two matrices and formats the output.

## Running The Program
1. ```spim```
2. ```load "matrix_multiplication.s"```
3. ```run```

## Clarification
The program asks for input in the form of ```n```, ```k```, and ```m```. These values represent the dimensions of the two matrices, so the multiplication will be performed on ```n```x```k``` and ```k```x```m``` matrices.
